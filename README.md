# Programm a Guessing Game

Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess.
After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct,
the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
